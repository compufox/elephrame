Elephant-Framework -- by [zac@computerfox.xyz](https://social.computerfox.xyz/@zac)

A framework that helps simplify the creation of bots for mastodon/pleroma

Uses [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) in the backend

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'elephrame'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install elephrame

## Quickstart

bot that posts "i'm gay" every three hours:

```ruby
require 'elephrame'

my_bot = Elephrame::Bots::Periodic.new '3h'

my_bot.run { |bot|
  bot.post("i'm gay")
}
```

	$ INSTANCE="https://mastodon.social" TOKEN="your_access_token" ruby bot.rb

Check the [examples](https://github.com/theZacAttacks/elephrame/tree/master/examples) directory for more example bots

### Bot Types

So far the framework support 5 bot types: Periodic, Interact, PeroidInteract, Reply, Command

- `Periodic` supports posting on a set schedule
- `Interact` supports callbacks for each type of interaction (favorites, boosts, replies, follows)
- `PeriodInteract` supports both of the above (I know, this isn't a good name)
- `Reply` only supports replying to mentions
- `Command` supports running code when mentioned with commands it recognizes

The string passed to `Periodic` and `PeroidInteract` must be either a 'Duration' string or a 'Cron' string, as parsable by [fugit](https://github.com/floraison/fugit)

## Usage

All the documentation is over at [RubyDoc](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/theZacAttacks/elephrame/)!

Every place that accepts a block provides access to the bot object. This allows for easy access to some provided helper methods, as well as the actual mastodon access object.

Exposed methods from bot object:

- `client` this is the underlying mastodon rest client we use in the backend. use this to make custom calls to the api for which we don't provide a helper
- `username` the name of the bot as fetched by verify_credentials
- `strip_html` (defaults to true) if set, the framework will automatically strip all html symbols from the post content
- `max_retries` (defaults to 5) the maximum amount of times the framework will retry a mastodon request
- `failed` a hash that represents the status of the last post or media upload. `failed[:post]` and `failed[:media]`; returns true if it failed, false if it succeeded 
- `post(content, visibility: 'unlisted', spoiler: '', reply_id: '', hide_media: false, media: [])` this provides an easy way to post statuses from inside code blocks
- `reply(content, *options)` a shorthand method to reply to the last mention (Note: only include the @ for the user who @ed the bot)
- `reply_with_mentions(content, *options)` similar to `reply` but includes all @s (respects #NoBot)
- `find_ancestor(id, depth = 10, stop_at = 1)` looks backwards through reply chains for the most recent post the bot made starting at post `id` until it hits `depth` number of posts, or finds `stop_at` number of it's own posts
- `no_bot?(account_id)` returns true if user with `account_id` has some form of "#NoBot" in their bio
